SQL is one of the most important tools in data analytics and data science.
Reasons enough to take a closer look at SQL.
This project uses the SQLite adapter for importing database files.
For example the Chinook, Northwind, HR, and movie databases are imported with queries.
The data is then transformed into pandas data frames.
Pandassql is applied for querying the data frames with SQL logic instead of 
Pandas native subsetting.A deeper look into queries is taken with the movie database.Several basic queries without joins are applied. This is the main focus of the project as queries are concerned.The query results are accompaniedby data visualization plots. A class query is constructed to make the tasks easier and the code cleaner.
